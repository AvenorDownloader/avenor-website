  // FAQ
  yt_faq_title: "FAQ",

  yt_q1: "Why is Avenor better than online sites?",
  yt_a1: "Online services often compress videos, are full of ads, and work slowly. Avenor downloads directly at your maximum internet speed, supports 4K/8K, allows clipping segments before downloading, and guarantees complete privacy.",

  yt_q2: "Is it really free?",
  yt_a2: "Yes. The free version allows you to download videos up to 1080p without watermarks or time limits. The PRO version is only needed for 4K/8K, batch playlist downloading, and advanced conversion features.",

  yt_q3: "Is it safe? Are there any viruses?",
  yt_a3: "Absolutely. Avenor is clean software. We do not embed ads, hidden miners, or toolbars. You can check the installer with any antivirus (e.g., VirusTotal) before running it.",

  yt_q4: "What formats are supported?",
  yt_a4: "You can download videos in MP4, MKV, WebM and audio in MP3, M4A, WAV. There is also a built-in converter that lets you recode downloaded files into any convenient format for your phone or player.",

  yt_q5: "Can I download an entire playlist or channel?",
  yt_a5: "Yes, Avenor can parse links to playlists and channels. In the PRO version, you can download all videos from the list with one click (Batch Download feature); in the free version, you can add them one by one.",

  yt_q6: "How do I download private videos?",
  yt_a6: "The app features a cookies import function (Netscape format). If you have access to the video in your browser, you can download it via Avenor using your cookies. This works for private videos, age-restricted content, and paid subscriptions (e.g., YouTube Premium).",
