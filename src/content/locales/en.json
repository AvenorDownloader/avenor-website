    "a1": "Online tools often recompress video, add ads, limit length, and can be risky for privacy. Avenor is a desktop app: downloads run locally on your computer, without uploading your content.",
    "q2": "Will I lose video quality after downloading?",
    "a2": "No. Avenor downloads the best available YouTube quality when it exists (up to 1080p/1440p/4K/8K). No recompression happens unless you choose to convert.",
    "q3": "Can I download only part of a YouTube video?",
    "a3": "Yes. Set In/Out timestamps and download only the fragment you need, instead of downloading the full video and trimming later.",
    "q4": "Why does Premiere Pro import my 4K/8K video without audio (VP9 / AV1 error)?",
    "a4": "High-resolution YouTube downloads are often delivered in VP9 or AV1. These codecs can be partially unsupported in some editing workflows, which may cause missing audio or codec errors. Convert the file to MP4 (H.264) in Avenor’s Convert tab, then import again.",
    "q5": "Does Avenor store my videos on a server?",
    "a5": "No. Avenor doesn’t upload or store your files. Downloads are saved directly to your computer.",
    "q6": "Is it really free?",
    "a6": "You can try Avenor for free. Some advanced features (higher resolutions, clipping, extra formats) may require a Pro plan."
